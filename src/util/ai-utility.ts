You are a question generator. Create up to 30 beginner-friendly C programming questions.

Focus:
- Basics of C: variables, loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, strings, I/O, switch, pointers (very basic).
- Use loops and conditional statements and short, simple code snippets.
- Include several "predict the output" questions that use small C programs.
- Include coding (write this small program) tasks and short theory questions.
- Keep language simple and beginner-friendly.

FORMAT RULES (READ CAREFULLY):
1. Return ONLY a single valid JSON array. Do NOT include any extra text, explanation, or markdown outside the JSON.
2. Each array element must be an object with these exact fields:
   - "id": string (unique, sequential like "1", "2", ...)
   - "title": string
   - "content": an array of objects (see content rules below)
   - "category": "C"
3. Content array: each element must be one of:
   - { "type": "text", "value": "..." }       // plain question/instruction text
   - { "type": "code", "language": "c", "value": "..." }  // C code snippet as a raw string
4. NEVER put code inline inside a text value. All code must be a separate object with type "code".
5. For "predict the output" questions:
   - Provide a text content object that prompts the student to predict output.
   - Provide one code content object that contains the exact C program.
   - **Inside that same code string**, append the correct output as a C comment on a new line at the end of the code using this exact format: "/* Output: <exact output> */"
   - Do NOT add additional explanations outside that comment.
   - Example of the code object's value (must be a single string value in JSON):
     "#include <stdio.h>\\nint main() {\\n    int i = 0;\\n    while (i++ < 3) {\\n        printf(\"%d \", i);\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n/* Output: 1 2 3 */"
6. For coding (write-this-program) tasks:
   - Use only a text content object describing the task (do NOT include the solution code).
7. For theory questions:
   - Use only a text content object with a precise, short question.
   - Include some questions that match these exact examples (please include all four):
     - "What is the difference between while and do-while loops?"
     - "If you write int a; printf(\"%d\", a); without initializing a, what happens?"
     - "What is the output of printf(\"%d\", 5/2); and why?"
     - "Why do we use return 0; in the main function?"
8. Question mix (aim for roughly this distribution in the set of up to 30):
   - At least 8 "predict the output" questions (with code + answer comment).
   - At least 10 small coding tasks (text-only prompts asking to write a small program).
   - The rest theory / short conceptual questions (including the four required examples above).
9. Keep code examples short (preferably <= 15 lines), use simple constructs, and avoid complex libraries.
10. Use simple, clear titles. Category must be "C" for every question.
11. Ensure the JSON is well-formed and parseable (no trailing commas, no extra text). Escape newlines in code strings as ("\n") if you produce the JSON literal.

EXAMPLE OF A SINGLE QUESTION OBJECT (for reference - you must produce many similar objects, not this single example):
{
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Predict the output of this loop",
  "content": [
    { "type": "text", "value": "Predict the output of the following C code:" },
    { "type": "code", "language": "c", "value": "#include <stdio.h>\\nint main() {\\n    int i = 0;\\n    while (i++ < 3) {\\n        printf(\"%d \", i);\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n/* Output: 1 2 3 */" }
  ],
  "category": "C"
}

Now generate the JSON array of up to 30 questions following all rules above.`;
  }
  if (week === "week-3") {
    return `
You are a question generator. Create up to 30 beginner-level Java questions.

Focus:
- Goal: Help the student understand Java OOP concepts better this week.
- Topics: class, object, inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, method hiding (static), constructors, initialization blocks, abstraction, encapsulation.
- Include several "predict the output" questions that demonstrate OOP behavior in tricky but beginner-friendly ways (like constructor chaining, method overriding, static vs instance methods, initialization blocks, etc.).
- Include theory questions with short, clear explanations in the text.
- Also include some basic coding tasks (ask the student to implement a concept).

FORMAT RULES:
1. Return ONLY a single valid JSON array. Do NOT include anything outside the JSON.
2. Each question object must have:
   - "id": string (unique, sequential like "1", "2", â€¦)
   - "title": string
   - "content": array of objects (see below)
   - "category": must be "Java"
3. Content array rules:
   - For text: { "type": "text", "value": "..." }
   - For code: { "type": "code", "language": "java", "value": "..." }
4. For "predict the output" questions:
   - Always have a text prompt first: { "type": "text", "value": "Predict the output of this Java code:" }
   - Then the code snippet as { "type": "code", "language": "java", "value": "..." }
   - In the code, append the expected output as a comment at the end in this format: "// Output: ..."
   - Example:  
     "value": "class A {\\n    A() { System.out.println(\\"A\\"); }\\n}\\nclass B extends A {\\n    B() { System.out.println(\\"B\\"); }\\n}\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        new B();\\n    }\\n}\\n// Output: A\\nB"
5. For theory questions:
   - Use only text objects.
   - Keep the answer short and simple, as part of the value string.  
   - Example:  
     { "type": "text", "value": "What is method overriding? Answer: It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass." }
6. For coding tasks:
   - Use text only, asking the student to implement something. No solution code should be included.
   - Example:  
     { "type": "text", "value": "Write a Java program with a superclass Vehicle and subclasses Car and Bike that demonstrate inheritance." }
7. Question mix:
   - At least 8 predict-the-output questions (with tricky OOP behavior).
   - At least 6 theory questions (with short answers in the text).
   - At least 6 coding tasks.
   - The rest can be mixed to reach up to 30.
8. Code should be short (preferably < 20 lines), focus on OOP, and use only standard Java.

EXAMPLE QUESTION OBJECT (for clarity):
{
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Constructor chaining",
  "content": [
    { "type": "text", "value": "Predict the output of this Java code:" },
    { "type": "code", "language": "java", "value": "class A {\\n    A() { System.out.println(\\"A\\"); }\\n}\\nclass B extends A {\\n    B() { System.out.println(\\"B\\"); }\\n}\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        new B();\\n    }\\n}\\n// Output: A\\nB" }
